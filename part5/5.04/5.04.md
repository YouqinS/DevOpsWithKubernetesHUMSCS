By reading official documentation and online materials, Rancher sounds a better option:

- Rancher
	- can manage Rancher-created clusters and also imported clusters
	- can run on any docker-based system
	- can easily manage multiple clusters from a single console and multi cluster operation stable for many years
	- follows industry best practices and uses tooling from CNCF
	- offers both web UI and CLI for automation
	- simple installation process (20min - 2days) (with helm) and easy to expand and build new clusters
	- easy to upgrade (helm chart or docker image)
	- open-source software/free

- OpenShift
	- relies heavily on Kubernetes operators as it is an actual distribution from the Kubernetes open source project
	- not always free: enterprise(Openshift Container Platform) and community(Openshift Origin)
	- chanllenging and time-consuming installation process (3days - weeks)
	- controller nodes can only be installed on RHEL (Fedora) CoreOS
	- favors its own tools&practices which creates vendor-lock and moving away from common community practice
	- multi cluster is still a retatively new featuer
	- upgrade has to involve OpenShift software and also its base Kubernetes distribution
